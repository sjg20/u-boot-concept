config DM
	bool "Enable Driver Model"
	depends on !SPL_BUILD
	help
	  This config option enables Driver Model. This brings in the core
	  support, including scanning of platform data on start-up. If
	  CONFIG_OF_CONTROL is enabled, the device tree will be scanned also
	  when available.

config DM_SERIAL
	bool "Enable Driver Model for serial"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for serial. This replaces
	  drivers/serial/serial.c with the serial uclass, which
	  implements serial_putc() etc. The uclass interface is
	  defined in include/serial.h.

config DM_GPIO
	bool "Enable Driver Model for GPIO"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for GPIO access. The standard GPIO
	  interface (gpio_get_value(), etc.) is then implemented by
	  the GPIO uclass. Drivers provide methods to query the
	  particular GPIOs that they provide. The uclass interface
	  is defined in include/asm-generic/gpio.h.

config DM_SPI
	bool "Enable Driver Model for SPI"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for SPI. The SPI slave interface
	  (spi_setup_slave(), spi_xfer(), etc.) is then implemented by
	  the SPI uclass. Drivers provide methods to access the SPI
	  buses that they control. The uclass interface is defined in
	  include/spi.h. The existing spi_slave structure is attached
	  as 'parent data' to every slave on each bus. Slaves
	  typically use driver-private data instead of extending the
	  spi_slave structure.

config DM_I2C
	bool "Enable Driver Model for I2C"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for I2C. This SPI flash interface
	  (spi_flash_probe(), spi_flash_write(), etc.) is then
	  implemented by the SPI flash uclass. There is one standard
	  SPI flash driver which knows how to probe most chips
	  supported by U-Boot. The uclass interface is defined in
	  include/spi_flash.h, but is currently fully compatible
	  with the old interface to avoid confusion and duplication
	  during the transition parent. SPI and SPI flash must be
	  enabled together (it is not possible to use driver model
	  for one and not the other).

config DM_SPI_FLASH
	bool "Enable Driver Model for SPI flash"
	depends on DM && SPI
	help
	  Enable driver model for SPI flash. This SPI flash interface
	  (spi_flash_probe(), spi_flash_write(), etc.) is then
	  implemented by the SPI flash uclass. There is one standard
	  SPI flash driver which knows how to probe most chips
	  supported by U-Boot. The uclass interface is defined in
	  include/spi_flash.h, but is currently fully compatible
	  with the old interface to avoid confusion and duplication
	  during the transition parent. SPI and SPI flash must be
	  enabled together (it is not possible to use driver model
	  for one and not the other).

config DM_CROS_EC
	bool "Enable Driver Model for Chrome OS EC"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for the Chrome OS EC interface. This
	  allows the cros_ec SPI driver to operate with CONFIG_DM_SPI
	  but otherwise makes few changes. Since cros_ec also supports
	  I2C and LPC (which don't support driver model yet), a full
	  conversion is not yet possible.

config SPL_DM
	bool "Enable Driver Model for SPL"
	depends on DM && SPL
	help
	  Enable driver model in SPL. You will need to provide a
	  suitable malloc() implementation. If you are not using the
	  full malloc() enabled by CONFIG_SYS_SPL_MALLOC_START,
	  consider using CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_SIMPLE. In that case you
	  must provide CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_F_LEN to set the size.
	  In most cases driver model will only allocate a few uclasses
	  and devices in SPL, so 1KB should be enable. See
	  CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_F_LEN for more details on how to enable it.

config DM_WARN
	bool "Enable warnings in driver model"
	help
	  The dm_warn() function can use up quite a bit of space for its
	  strings. By default this is disabled for SPL builds to save space.
	  This will cause dm_warn() to be compiled out - it will do nothing
	  when called.
	depends on DM
	default y if !SPL_BUILD
	default n if SPL_BUILD

config DM_DEVICE_REMOVE
	bool "Support device removal"
	help
	  We can save some code space by dropping support for removing a
	  device. This is not normally required in SPL, so by default this
	  option is disabled for SPL.
	depends on DM
	default y if !SPL_BUILD
	default n if SPL_BUILD

config DM_STDIO
	bool "Support stdio registration"
	help
	  Normally serial drivers register with stdio so that they can be used
	  as normal output devices. In SPL we don't normally use stdio, so
	  we can omit this feature.
