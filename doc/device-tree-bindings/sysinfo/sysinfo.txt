Sysinfo
=======

This provides capabilities to access information about a board/system, for
use by drivers.

Required properties:

  - compatible: any suitable string where the driver is in the UCLASS_SYSINFO
      class

Optional properties:

   - probe-devices: a list of phandles of devices to probe. Note that the
       boot-phase tags (bootph-pre-ram etc.) may result in nodes being ignored
       in which case those devices will not be probed.

Example

sysinfo {
	compatible = "sandbox,sysinfo-sandbox";
};
