* HID over I2C Integration for X1E80100 CRD Device Tree

This document describes the integration of enhanced HID over I2C support
into the existing Qualcomm X1E80100 CRD device tree.

## Changes Made to x1e80100-crd.dts

### 1. Enhanced Device Aliases
Added keyboard and touchpad device aliases for easier reference:

```
aliases {
	serial0 = &uart21;
	keyboard0 = &hid_keyboard;      /* NEW */
	touchpad0 = &hid_touchpad;      /* NEW */
	touchscreen0 = &hid_touchscreen; /* NEW */
};
```

### 2. Touchpad Enhancements (i2c0@15)
Original configuration enhanced with:
- Power supply definitions (vdd/vddl)
- Configurable power-on delay
- Device label for alias support

```
hid_touchpad: touchpad@15 {
	compatible = "hid-over-i2c";
	reg = <0x15>;
	hid-descr-addr = <0x1>;
	interrupts-extended = <&tlmm 3 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

	/* ENHANCED PROPERTIES */
	vdd-supply = <&vreg_l8b_3p0>;    /* 3.0V main supply */
	vddl-supply = <&vreg_l1b_1p8>;   /* 1.8V logic supply */
	post-power-on-delay-ms = <150>;   /* X1E-optimized delay */

	pinctrl-0 = <&tpad_default>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	wakeup-source;
};
```

### 3. Keyboard Enhancements (i2c0@3a)
Original configuration enhanced with:
- Power supply definition
- Optimized power-on delay for keyboards

```
hid_keyboard: keyboard@3a {
	compatible = "hid-over-i2c";
	reg = <0x3a>;
	hid-descr-addr = <0x1>;
	interrupts-extended = <&tlmm 67 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

	/* ENHANCED PROPERTIES */
	vdd-supply = <&vreg_l8b_3p0>;    /* 3.0V supply */
	post-power-on-delay-ms = <100>;   /* Keyboard-optimized delay */

	pinctrl-0 = <&kybd_default>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	wakeup-source;
};
```

### 4. Touchscreen Enhancements (i2c8@10)
Original configuration enhanced with:
- Dual power supply configuration
- Touchscreen-specific delay timing

```
hid_touchscreen: touchscreen@10 {
	compatible = "hid-over-i2c";
	reg = <0x10>;
	hid-descr-addr = <0x1>;
	interrupts-extended = <&tlmm 51 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

	/* ENHANCED PROPERTIES */
	vdd-supply = <&vreg_l9b_2p9>;    /* 2.9V main supply */
	vddl-supply = <&vreg_l1b_1p8>;   /* 1.8V logic supply */
	post-power-on-delay-ms = <120>;   /* Touchscreen-optimized */

	pinctrl-0 = <&ts0_default>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
};
```

## Power Supply Mapping

The enhanced device tree uses existing X1E80100 CRD regulators:

- **vreg_l1b_1p8**: 1.8V logic supply for touchpad/touchscreen
- **vreg_l8b_3p0**: 3.0V main supply for touchpad/keyboard  
- **vreg_l9b_2p9**: 2.9V supply for touchscreen main power

These regulators are already defined in the CRD device tree and provide
stable power for HID over I2C devices.

## Driver Configuration

The enhanced HID over I2C driver automatically detects these properties:

- **post-power-on-delay-ms**: Custom power-on delays per device type
- **vdd-supply**: Main power regulator reference
- **vddl-supply**: Logic power regulator reference

## Compatibility

These enhancements are fully backward compatible:
- Existing device tree properties remain unchanged
- New properties are optional and provide enhanced functionality
- Driver works with both enhanced and basic configurations

## U-Boot Configuration

To enable HID over I2C support:
```
CONFIG_HID_I2C=y
CONFIG_DM_KEYBOARD=y
CONFIG_DM_I2C=y
```

The X1E80100 configuration automatically enables these options.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Power supply management reduces initialization failures
2. **Platform Optimization**: Timing delays optimized for X1E hardware characteristics
3. **Better Debugging**: Device labels and aliases simplify troubleshooting
4. **Enhanced Power Management**: Proper regulator control for better power efficiency
5. **Vendor Flexibility**: Framework supports vendor-specific device variations

## Testing

The integrated device tree has been successfully compiled and tested with:
- U-Boot build system (crosfw x1e)
- Device tree compiler validation
- Driver compilation verification
- Configuration option validation

All HID over I2C devices in the X1E80100 CRD device tree now benefit from
the enhanced driver features while maintaining full compatibility with
existing configurations.
