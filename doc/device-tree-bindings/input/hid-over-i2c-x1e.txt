* HID over I2C Device-Tree bindings for Qualcomm X1E80100 platforms

This binding extends the standard hid-over-i2c binding with specific
configurations optimized for Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite (X1E80100) platforms.

The HID over I2C driver supports keyboards, touchpads, touchscreens, and other
HID devices commonly found on X1E80100-based laptops.

Required properties:
- compatible: must include "hid-over-i2c", may also include vendor-specific
  strings for better device identification:
  * "elan,ekth3000" - ELAN touchpads (older)
  * "elan,ekth3500" - ELAN touchpads (newer)
  * "synaptics,tm3038-005" - Synaptics touchpads
  * "synaptics,tm3253-005" - Synaptics touchpads (alternative)
  * "wacom,w9013" - Wacom digitizers/stylus devices
- reg: I2C slave address (commonly 0x15, 0x2C, or 0x10)
- hid-descr-addr: HID descriptor address (commonly 0x0001 or 0x0020)
- interrupts: interrupt specification

Optional properties (commonly used on X1E platforms):
- vdd-supply: 3.0V main power supply regulator
- vddl-supply: 1.8V logic power supply regulator  
- post-power-on-delay-ms: Delay in milliseconds after power-on before
  device communication (default 200ms, range 100-500ms)
- touchscreen-inverted-x: boolean, X axis is inverted
- touchscreen-inverted-y: boolean, Y axis is inverted
- touchscreen-size-x: X resolution for touchscreens
- touchscreen-size-y: Y resolution for touchscreens

X1E80100-specific considerations:
- Many devices require longer power-on delays (100-200ms)
- ELAN devices typically use I2C address 0x15 or 0x2C
- Synaptics devices commonly use 0x2C
- Keyboards often use HID descriptor address 0x0020
- Touchpads typically use 0x0001

Examples:

1. ELAN touchpad (common on X1E laptops):
	touchpad@15 {
		compatible = "elan,ekth3000", "hid-over-i2c";
		reg = <0x15>;
		hid-descr-addr = <0x0001>;
		interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
		interrupts = <12 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		
		vdd-supply = <&vreg_l8a_3p0>;
		vddl-supply = <&vreg_l7a_1p8>;
		post-power-on-delay-ms = <150>;
	};

2. Generic HID keyboard:
	keyboard@2c {
		compatible = "hid-over-i2c";
		reg = <0x2c>;
		hid-descr-addr = <0x0020>;
		interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
		interrupts = <33 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		
		vdd-supply = <&vreg_l8a_3p0>;
		post-power-on-delay-ms = <100>;
	};

3. Synaptics touchpad:
	touchpad@2c {
		compatible = "synaptics,tm3038-005", "hid-over-i2c";
		reg = <0x2c>;
		hid-descr-addr = <0x0001>;
		interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
		interrupts = <9 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
		
		vdd-supply = <&vreg_l8a_3p0>;
		vddl-supply = <&vreg_l7a_1p8>;
		post-power-on-delay-ms = <120>;
		
		touchscreen-inverted-x;
	};

4. Wacom digitizer/stylus:
	digitizer@10 {
		compatible = "wacom,w9013", "hid-over-i2c";
		reg = <0x10>;
		hid-descr-addr = <0x0001>;
		interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
		interrupts = <31 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		
		vdd-supply = <&vreg_l9a_3p0>;
		vddl-supply = <&vreg_l7a_1p8>;
		post-power-on-delay-ms = <200>;
		
		touchscreen-size-x = <21600>;
		touchscreen-size-y = <13500>;
	};

Driver Configuration:
To enable HID over I2C support, set CONFIG_HID_I2C=y in your U-Boot config.
This driver depends on CONFIG_DM_KEYBOARD and CONFIG_DM_I2C.

Troubleshooting:
- If the device is not detected, verify the I2C address and HID descriptor address
- Increase post-power-on-delay-ms if the device fails to respond after reset
- Check power supply configurations (vdd/vddl) match the device requirements
- Ensure interrupt configuration matches the device's requirements
- Some devices may require specific vendor-compatible strings for proper initialization
