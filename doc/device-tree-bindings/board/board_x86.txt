x86 board driver
================

This driver allows providing board-specific features such as power control
GPIOs. In addition, the SMBIOS values can be specified in the device tree,
as below:

An optional 'smbios' subnode can be used to provide these properties.

Optional properties:
  - manufacturer: Product manufacturer for system / baseboard
  - product:      Product name
  - version:      Product version string
  - serial:       Serial number for system (note that this can be overridden by
                      the serial# environment variable)
  - sku:          Product SKU (Stock-Keeping Unit)
  - family:       Product family
  - asset-tag:    Asset tag for the motherboard, sometimes used in organisations
                      to track devices


Example:

	board {
		compatible = "google,coral";

		smbios {
			manufacturer = "Google";
			product = "Coral";
			version = "rev2";
			serial = "123456789";
			sku = "sku3";
			family = "Google_Coral";
			asset-tag = "ABC123";
		};
	};
