Output files
============

This describes some of the output files produced by the U-Boot build.

include/generated/cfg_value.h
    Contains integer values of hard-to-calculate ad-hoc CONFIG options.

    Some ad-hoc CONFIG options are a pain to convert to Kconfig since the
    value is an expression referring to various other variables in the source
    tree. Figuring this out can involve lots of searching and hex addition,
    since running the program on the board (with a printf() added) is only
    possible if you have the board.

    This file contains the calculated 32-bit hex values of any CONFIG options
    that seem to consist of expressions. It is purely used as a migration aid,
    not intended to be included by user code.

    Example::

        #ifndef __CFGV_H__
        #define __CFGV_H__
        /*
         * Provides values of hard-to-calculate ad-hoc CONFIG options
         *
         * This file was generated by Kbuild
         */

        #define CONFIG_SYS_TIMER_RATE 0x8f0d1 /* CONFIG_SYS_TIMER_RATE @ */
        #define CONFIG_SYS_BARGSIZE 0x400 /* CONFIG_SYS_BARGSIZE @ */
        #define CONFIG_SYS_PBSIZE 0x414 /* CONFIG_SYS_PBSIZE @ */
        ...

u-boot.cfg
    Contains the various CONFIG options defined by the build, in C header
    format. This includes both Kconfig options and ad-hoc CONFIG options;
    anything that starts with `CONFIG_` is included.

    This file is useful for seeing what options the build uses. It is also used
    by U-Boot to check against the config whitelist file,
    `config_whitelist.txt`.

    Example::

        #define CONFIG_SYS_TIMER_COUNTS_DOWN
        #define CONFIG_ETH 1
        #define CONFIG_CMD_FAT 1
        #define CONFIG_BOOTM_NETBSD 1
        #define CONFIG_CMD_FDT 1
        ...
