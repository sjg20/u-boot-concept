Labman - Lab Manager
====================

A lab is a collection of test devices, servers and associated equipment to
connect them together. The purpose of a lab is to build and run tests and
provide access to the test devices for general use.

Labman is a program for keeping track of your lab.

You can use labman to:
- define available boards and how they are connected. E.g. a LinkSprite pcduino3
    may have an uSD connection to an SDwire, a UART connection to a USB UART
    dongle, a relay for reset and a YKUSH board for power.
- generate a list of avalable boards
- check that a board is working correctly
- generate a list of things to do to get all boards working fully
- generate board config files for tbot
- generate board config files for pytest
- launch tbot or pytest
